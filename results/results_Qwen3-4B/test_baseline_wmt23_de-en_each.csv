409,"Der Wunsch, Videospiele zu entwickeln wurde bei mir durch das Aufkommen der 3D-Echtzeit-Technologie entfacht, die plötzlich jede Menge neuer Möglichkeiten eröffnete und mir als ein neues Ausdrucksmittel erschien, mithilfe dessen man die Welt an ihre Grenzen stoßen lassen konnte. Sie stellte für mich eine Möglichkeit dar, neue Horizonte zu erschließen. Ich kam mir wie ein cinematographischer Pionier zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts vor: Zum einen mühte ich mich zwar mit der noch unausgereiften Technik ab, aber zum anderen war ich mir bewusst, dass es noch alles zu entdecken galt - insbesondere eine neue Sprache, die sowohl narrativ als auch visuell zu sein hatte. Um ganz ehrlich zu sein, konnten die nächsten zehn Jahre meinen Hunger nicht stillen. Ich hatte das dumpfe Gefühl, dass die Videospiele nur einen winzigen Teil ihrer erstaunlichen kreativen Möglichkeiten ausnutzten, weil sie zu sehr auf „Action“ aus waren und darüber ein fundamentales Element der menschlichen Erfahrungswelt vergaßen: die Empfindungen. Inzwischen machte die Technologie weiterhin rasante Fortschritte. Fahrenheit stellt meinen Beitrag dazu dar, Videospiele zu einem wahren, Empfindungen übermittelnden Ausdrucksmittel zu machen. Auch wenn dies natürlich in völlig anderer Form hätte geschehen können, so ist Fahrenheits größter Verdienst doch die Tatsache, dass hier reelle Fragen aufgeworfen und konkrete Antworten angeboten werden. Fahrenheit ist der Beweis dafür, dass man durchaus ein interaktives Spielerlebnis kreieren kann, das nicht nur darauf basiert, in dunklen Korridoren gegen abscheuliche Monster zu kämpfen und auf Kisten zu ballern, um sich Munition zu beschaffen, sondern weit anspruchsvollere und tiefgehendere Inhalte besitzt. Es ist der Beweis dafür, dass man sowohl eine Story erzählen als auch einen Spielinhalt anbieten kann, ohne deswegen die narrativen oder die interaktiven Elemente opfern zu müssen. Ich hoffe, dass sowohl eingefleischte Gamer als auch Gelegenheitsspieler Spaß an diesem neuen Spielerlebnis haben werden. Sollten Sie Videospielen gegenüber eher skeptisch eingestellt sein, darf ich hoffen, dass Fahrenheit dazu beiträgt, Ihre diesbezügliche Einstellung zu ändern. Mögen auch andere Entwickler den Wunsch verspüren, diesen neuen kreativen Pfad einzuschlagen und ihn mit ihren eigenen Inspirationen, ihrem Talent und Ehrgeiz bereichern. Die Interaktivität steckt noch in den Kinderschuhen und bietet die Chance, erst noch alles entdecken zu können. In den vergangenen zwei Jahren hat Fahrenheit einen großen Teil unseres Lebens ausgefüllt und stellte für das gesamte Quantic Dream-Team ein unvergessliches zwischenmenschliches und intellektuelles Abenteuer dar, bei dem wir uns immer wieder gezwungen sahen, viele der zuvor als unumstößlich erachteten Grundsätze in Frage zu stellen. Ich würde mich glücklich schätzen, wenn Fahrenheit - ähnlich wie Bücher, Filme und Songs, die einen bleibenden Eindruck bei Ihnen hinterlassen haben - ebenfalls nicht ganz spurlos an Ihnen vorüber geht. David Cage","The desire to develop video games was ignited in me after the rise of real-time 3D technology, which suddenly opened up a number of new possibilities and seemed to be a new form of expression to me which could be used to help push the world to its limits. It represented an opportunity for me to open up new horizons. I felt like a cinematic pioneer in the early 20th century: While I struggled with the untested technology, I knew that everything was still left to discover - especially a new language, which was to be both narrative and visual. To be completely honest, the next 10 years weren’t able to satisfy my hunger. I had a nagging feeling that video games were only satisfying a small part of their vast creative potential because they were more focused on ""action"" and were therefore forgetting a fundamental element of the human experience: emotions. In the meantime, the technology continued to rapidly progress. Fahrenheit represents my contribution to making video games a real form of expressing emotions. Even though this could have naturally happened in a completely different way, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that real questions are asked, and specific answers are provided. Fahrenheit is proof that it is possible to create an interactive gaming experience that isn’t only based on fighting hideous monsters in dark hallways and shooting at boxes to get ammunition, but it contains much more sophisticated and meaningful content. It is proof that you can both tell a story and offer gaming content without having to sacrifice the narrative or interactive elements. I hope that both die-hard gamers and casual gamers will have fun with this new gaming experience. If you are somewhat skeptical of video games, I hope that Fahrenheit changes your views on this. May other developers also feel the desire to take this new creative journey and enrich it with their own inspiration, their talent, and ambition. Interactivity is still in its infancy and still offers the opportunity to discover everything. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has consumed a large part of our lives and was an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the whole Quantic Dream team, during which we always felt compelled to question many of the principles that had previously been considered unbreakable. I would consider myself lucky if Fahrenheit - like with books, movies, and songs that leave a lasting impression on you - also doesn’t pass you by without leaving an impression on you.

463,"Ich habe mich hier durch die teils überschwänglichen Rezensionen wohl blenden lassen. Vorausschicken möchte ich, dass ich bereits 2 Rucksäcke von Lowepro im Einsatz habe. Einen sehr großen (zur Aufbewahrung der Ausrüstung) und einen ziemlich kleinen für die wichtigsten, alltäglichen Dinge, die man mal eben mitnimmt. Dadurch, dass ich mir gerade das Sigma 70-200 2.8 gekauft habe, ist der kleine Lowepro nun endgültig zu klein geworden und ich benötige Ersatz. Beim Prime Day habe ich diesen Rucksack für einen wirklich sehr erschwinglichen Preis (knapp 29 EUR) erworben und war eigentlich sehr froh über diesen Kauf, hatte ich mir doch viele der Rezensionen vorab durchgelesen. Als der Rucksack dann gestern kam, folgte die Ernüchterung: Der Rucksack ist für unter 30 EUR nicht schlecht, das kann man nicht sagen. Aber dass er (wie in vielen Rezensionen geschrieben) mit den namhaften Produkten, welche zu weit höheren Preisen verkauft werden, mithalten kann .... Leute, das stimmt einfach nicht! Ich hatte wirklich gehofft, dass es so ist, aber davon kann echt keine Rede sein. Die gepolsterten Wände sind wesentlich dünner und bieten nicht einen solchen Schutz, wie meine Lowepro. Ach die Trennungen innen, sind von einem anderen Kaliber, wesentlich labbriger. Insgesamt ist die Haptik dieses Rucksacks nicht mit der meinen Lowepro zu vergleichen. Auch die Reisverschlüsse und die Materialien der Fächer für das Kleinmaterial sind nicht gerade hochwertig. Daher habe ich für mich entschieden, dass der Rucksack zurück geht. Wenn ich mir eine Ausrüstung von vielen Tausend EUR anschaffe, dann muss ich leider auch das Geld für einen vernünftigen Rucksack in die Hand nehmen. Qualität hat hier anscheinend doch seinen Preis. Für jemanden, der nicht viel Geld ausgeben möchte, ist der Rucksack bestimmt eine gute Wahl, für mich jedoch nicht. Und es ist auch nicht so, dass mir die Entscheidung schwer gefallen ist. Als ich den Rucksack ausgepackt habe, wusste ich nach 2 Minuten, dass er zurück geht. Was mir gut gefallen hat, ist die Farbe innen. Hier findet man seine Sachen bestimmt sehr viel schneller, als mit einem grauen Innenleben. Für jemanden, der andere Ansprüche an einen Rucksack hat, ist der Rucksack bestimmt eine tolle Sache, meiner geht jedoch zurück.","Here, I have allowed myself to be dazzled by the sometimes-exaggerated reviews. I would like to say in advance, that I already use 2 Lowepro backpacks. One is very large (to store equipment), and a fairly small one for the most important everyday items that you usually take with you. Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the smaller Lowepro is now too small, and I needed a replacement. On Prime Day, I got this backpack for a really affordable price (about 29 euros) and I was actually very happy with this purchase, if only I had read some of the reviews first. When the backpack arrived yesterday, the disillusionment followed: the backpack is not bad for less than 30 euros, you can't say that. But that it (as was written in many of the reviews) can be compared to well-known products that are sold for much higher prices .... People, that is simply not true! I was really hoping that this would be true, but that is not true. The padded sides are much thinner and do not offer as much protection as my Lowepro. And the dividers inside are of a different caliber and considerably sloppier. Overall, the feel of this backpack cannot be compared to my Lowepro. Ever the zippers and the materials used in the compartments for the small items, aren't even high quality. That is why I have decided to return the backpack. When I purchase equipment for many thousands of euros, then I should also spend money on a decent backpack. In this case quality also apparently has a price. For someone who does not want to spend a lot of money, this is probably a good backpack, just not for me. And it's not like this was a hard decision for me to. As I was unpacking the backpack, I knew in about 2 minutes that it would be going back. What I really liked, was the color of the interior. I'm sure you can find things a lot faster than with a gray interior. For someone who has different requirements for a backpack, this backpack is certainly a good thing; however, mine is going back.","I have been somewhat blinded by the sometimes overly enthusiastic reviews.

But the fact that it (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices... People, that's simply not true!

Die ersten zwei Bücher fand ich sehr stark und auch empfehlenswert und hatte mich wirklich sehr auf den dritten Teil gefreut. In dem Teil gehts die ganze Zeit um die Gefühle von Volt und Taylor und ich fand es unnötig in die Länge gezogen. Taylor schwärmt schon so lange von Volt, gesteht sich endlich alles ein und ist dann bei jedem Streit wie ein kleines Kind und verzieht sich?! Gleichzeitig gab es auch Unstimmigkeiten, meines Empfindens, denn am Ende vom zweiten Teil hat Volt noch versucht Taylors Ex zu überzeugen und ihm nicht geglaubt als er sagte, Taylor würde auf ihn stehen und versucht den Ex zu überzeugen dass Taylor ohne ihn nicht könne und er es selber gehört habe. Aber am Anfang vom dritten Teil scheint Volt alles vergessen zu haben und kämpft um Taylor. Ich hatte gehofft, dass das der letzte Teil der Reihe ist und denke, dass dieser Teil der schwächste ist und auch gleichzeitig ziemlich unnötig.

At the same time, there were discrepancies, in my opinion, because at the end of the second installment, Volt tried to convince Taylor's ex and did not believe him when he said that Taylor liked him and tried to convince Taylor's ex that Taylor could not live without him and he had heard this himself. But at the beginning of the third installment, it appears that Volt has forgotten all of this and fights for Taylor. I had hoped, that this was the last installment in the series, and I think this installment in the series is the weakest and at the same time very unnecessary. Nevertheless, I will read the fourth installment and hope that it finally comes out that Taylor's friend Sarah is Volt's ex. That would bring back more suspense to the story.","So far, the Electric Series by E. L. Todd has been the best, but my opinion was revised with this book.

Damit ist gemeint, dass nicht mehr geladen wird obwohl man den ""Power On/Off"" Button 3 Sekunden lang betätigt hat. Wenn man das Handy aus der Hülle entfernt und wieder einbaut löst man zwar in 70% der Fälle das Problem, jedoch entsteht dadurch ein neuer Mangel. 2) Durch häufiges entfernen und wieder einbauen des Handys in die Hülle ist der Deckel mittlerweile so verschlissen, dass er sich von selbst von der Hülle löst, weshalb ich ihn schon mehrmals fast verloren hätte. Das sind zwar nicht viele grobe Mängel jedoch finde ich, dass eine Hülle mit Akku gerade in ihrer Funktion einwandfrei funktionieren sollte und deshalb bin ich, für die Kosten von 30€, sehr enttäuscht über das Produkt, vor allem weil ich es erst seit 3 Monaten verwende.","Does not work perfectly !!!

When you take the cell phone out of the case and then put it back in, you do solve the problem 70% of the time, but doing so causes another issue. 2) By taking the cell phone out of its case and putting it back in a lot, the lid gets so worn out, that it falls off of the case by itself, which is why I have almost lost it several times. These are not really major defects, but I think a case with a battery should work perfectly and that is why I, for a price of 30€, was very disappointed in this product, especially since I have only been using it for 3 months.","The function is not quite flawless!!!

When the phone is removed from the case and reinserted, the problem is resolved in 70% of cases, but this creates a new defect. 2) Due to frequent removal and reinsertion of the phone into the case, the lid is now so worn that it comes off by itself, which is why I have almost lost it several times.

Dabei scheint das Thermometer noch intakt zu sein, hier werden weiterhin plausible Werte angezeigt.

499,"Abgesehen davon, dass der erste Versuch der Lieferung Stand heute immer noch munter mit Hermes durch die Republik fährt, ohne den Weg zu mir oder zurück zu Amazon zu finden, war der Service von Amazon mit dem Auslösen einer Ersatzlieferung wie immer hervorragend. Der Mäher ist schnell bei mir angekommen und machte einen wertigen Eindruck. Der Motor ist stark und es ergibt sich ein schönes Schnittbild. Die Lautstärke ist nicht gerade beeindruckend niedrig, aber ok. Großes Manko ist leider der Fangkorb. Zum einen ist er nur oben und unten aus Hartplastik und dazwischen aus Stoff. Wenn man ihn voll nur kurz absetzt, dann wird er natürlich zusammengedrückt und Teile des Inhalts fallen raus. Schlimmer aber ist, dass die eigentlich praktische Füllstandsanzeige schon bei halb vollem Fangkorb auf rot zeigt. Das wäre ja noch nicht so schlimm, wenn der Mäher nicht von da an große Teile des Schnittguts verlieren würde. Den Korb bei einer großen Rasenfläche immer zu leeren, wenn er erst halb voll ist, kann nun nicht die Lösung sein. Daher habe ich das Gerät so gut wie möglich gesäubert und zurückgeschickt. Fazit: Grundsätzlich ein sehr guter Mäher, der durch die unglückliche Konstruktion des Fangkorbs aber für mich unbrauchbar wird.","Despite the fact that the first delivery attempt as of today is still out driving through the republic without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon’s service with initiating a replacement deliver is outstanding as always. The mower arrived quickly and made a good first impression. The motor is strong, and it leaves a nice cut pattern. The volume isn't exactly impressively low, but okay. A big issue is the catcher attachment. For one thing, only the top and bottom are made of hard plastic and in between out of fabric. If you take it off briefly when it is full, the two halves of course collapse together and some of the contents fall out. But what's worse is actually that the very practical fill level indicator already turns red when the catcher attachment is only half full. This wouldn't be so bad, if the mower didn't lose large quantities of the grass clippings from that point forward. Emptying the catcher every time it is only half full if you have a large lawn can't be the solution. That's why I cleaned the device as well as possible and sent it back. Conclusion: A very good mower in principle, which because of the unfortunate construction of the catcher attachment is completely unusable for me.","Apart from the fact that the first delivery attempt today was still lively with Hermes delivering through the Republic without finding the way to me or back to Amazon, the Amazon service with triggering a replacement delivery was as always excellent. The mower arrived quickly and made a good impression. The engine is strong and the cutting performance is nice. The noise level is not particularly low, but it's okay. The main drawback is the grass collector. First of all, it is only made of hard plastic on top and bottom and fabric in between. If you just set it down full, it naturally compresses and parts of the contents fall out. Worse still, the actually practical fill level indicator already turns red when the grass collector is half full. That would not be so bad if the mower did not then lose large parts of the cut grass from there. Always emptying the basket whenever it is only half full on a large lawn area can no longer be the solution. Therefore, I have cleaned the device as thoroughly as possible and sent it back. Conclusion: Basically a very good mower, but due to the unfortunate design of the grass collector, it becomes unusable for me.","Apart from the fact that the first delivery attempt today was still active with Hermes delivering through the Republic without finding the way to me or back to Amazon, the Amazon service with triggering a replacement delivery was as always excellent. The mower arrived quickly and made a good impression. The engine is strong and the cutting performance is nice. The noise level is not particularly low, but it's okay. The main drawback is the grass collector. First of all, it is only made of hard plastic on top and bottom and fabric in between. If you set it down full, it naturally compresses and parts of the contents fall out. Worse still, the actually practical fill level indicator already turns red when the grass collector is half full.

501,"Ich habe zwei dieser Geräte. Das Gerät lässt sich einfach über die App integrieren. Sehr gut ist das mitgelieferte einsteckbare Sensorkabel, was sich bei Bedarf auch verlängern lässt. Das Gerät ist solide aufgebaut. Raumtemperatur und Luftfeuchtigkeit werden angezeigt, aber zur Schonung der Batterie nur einmal bis dreimal am Tag (einstellbar) in der App angezeigt. Aus folgenden Gründen gebe ich nur 4 Sterne. - Die weiche Rückwand des Gerätes, die auch das Batteriefach verschließt lässt sich nur recht fummelig wieder verschließen. - Eines der beiden Geräte ist in einem Raum mit recht dicken Wänden. Diese Gerät verliert alle 1 bis 2 Wochen die Verbindung zum Netzwerk. Leider verbindet sich das Gerät nicht wieder von selbst, auch wenn man es in die Nähe des Routers legt. Man muss die Batterien rausnehmen und nach kurzer Pause wieder einlegen, dann verbindet es sich wieder. Das sollte eigentlich ohne Batterie entfernen funktionieren. Immer gibt es einen Alarm, wenn die Verbindung verloren geht. - Der Alarmton könnte noch etwas lauter sein.","I have two of these devices.

I only gave it 4 stars for the following reasons. -The device's soft back panel, which also secures the battery compartment, only closes if you play with it. -One of the two devices is in a room with relatively thick walls. This device loses its connection to the network every week or two. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect automatically, even if it is placed in the vicinity of the router. You have to take the battery out and after a short wait, put it back in, then the device will reconnect. This should actually work without removing the battery.

515,"Hätte man besser durchdenken können. Da ich öfters mit vielen unterschiedlichen Schlüsseln zu tun habe, dachte ich mir so ein Organizer ist angenehmer, als die ganze Zeit mit einem riesigen Schlüsselbund rumzulaufen. Anfangs ging auch alles recht gut. Allerdings ging dann recht schnell der Lack ab und die Schrauben mussten immer nachgezogen werden. Schön, dass das auch mit einer Cent Münze geht, aber auch nur mit einer Cent Münze. Einen passenden Schlitzschraubenzieher habe ich nicht gefunden, der nicht sofort die ganze schraube ruiniert hätte. Um nun zum nervigsten an der ganzen Sache zu kommen: das Anbringen der Schlüssel. Schön ist das man durch die verschiedenen Teile, die Schraube auf verschiedene Größen bzw. Längen stellen kann, sollte man das ganze dann aber erstmal verschraubt haben, braucht man eine Zange, um das ganze wieder auseinander zu bringen. Das Anbringen der Schlüssel an sich ist einfach ein Gedulds-, Balance- und Geschicklichkeitsspiel. Letztendlich ist mir beim Dritten mal Montieren die Schraube im Gewinde abgebrochen und damit das komplette Ding unbrauchbar. Fazit: Wenn überhaupt dann für nur einmal alle nötigen Schlüssel und dann nie wieder, aber bei dem Preis kann man sich auch eine günstigere Alternative kaufen.","Could have been thought through better.

It's nice that you can use the various parts to set the screw at various sizes and lengths, but if you have screwed the whole things already, you need pliers to take it all apart again. Attaching the keys is quite simply a game of a patience, balance, and skill. Finally, the third time I mounted the screws, the threads of the screws broke off and the whole thing became unusable.

Da ich keinen Vergleich habe (mein erstes Organizer Set), werde ich die Ware erst nach dem ersten Einsatz tatsächlich beurteilen können.

Anzumerken ist noch, dass nicht 8, sondern 10 Teile geliefert wurden, da in dem runden Kosmetikbeutel noch zwei kleinere Täschchen/Tütchen enthalten waren. Nicht hochwertig verarbeitet, erwähnen wollte ich das trotzdem. Dass der Kosmetikbeutel einen anderen Farbton hat und aus anderem Material besteht, als die übrigen Bags, stört mich persönlich nicht.

After all, you should spend time with the dog, not with its collar.

536,"Passt perfekt - aber Original? Mein letztes Paar Crocs ist nach 5 Jahren leider kaputt gegangen, sodass ich mir mit Freude neue bestellt habe. Diese hier sind leider auf den ersten Blick schlecht verarbeitet. Bequem sind sie genau so wie die, die ich vorher besaß.

538,"Da hier noch kaum Bewertungen zu lesen sind, war ich erst sehr skeptisch. Da ich allerdings dieses Jahr zu einem Festival fahre und gerne im Auto schlafen würde, habe ich sie dann doch mal auf gut Glück bestellt. Zum Lieferumfang waren die Matratze und eine Autoluftpumpe enthalten. Zur Matratze: Ich habe sie testweise in das Auto (Citroen Berlingo) ausgelegt. Dabei ist mir aufgefallen, dass auf einer Seite sich etwas Schimmel befindet. Ich habe es weggewischt und hoffe mal, dass dieser nicht wieder auftaucht. Im aufgepumpten Zustand wurde direkt ein Liegetest durchgeführt. Es lässt sich gut darauf liegen und passt super zum Festival. Natürlich kann diese Matratze nicht das eigene Bett ersetzen, aber die für Tage auf der Veranstaltung ist sie der pure Luxus. Die Matratze passt wunderbar in mein Auto hinein. Zuvor haben wir die Sitze hinten herausgenommen. Somit passt es perfekt. Die Luftpumpe: Die Luftpumpe hat verschiedene Adapter. Die Matratze benötigt zwei verschiedene Adapter, welche auch an der Pumpe zu finden sind. Die Pumpe wird in den Zigarettenanzünder des Autos gesteckt. Allerdings war der Stecker defekt (etwas an der Lötstelle). Da mein Freund handwerklich begabt ist, hat er es reparieren können und wieder zusammengebaut funktionierte das gute Teil hervorragend und pumpte die Matratze in Null Komma Nix auf. Insgesamt bin ich sehr begeistert von der Matratze. Ich bin dann mal gespannt auf den Härtetest auf dem Festival. Ich erhoffe mir, dass sie keine Luft verliert und auch lange hält. Ebenso, dass er Schimmel nicht wieder auftaucht. Nach dem Test kann ich sie auf jeden Fall schonmal empfehlen. Sofern ich noch andere Erfahrungen machen sollte, werde ich entsprechend die Rezension überarbeiten (sofern möglich).","Since there are not many recommendations to read here anymore, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I am driving to a festival this year and would like to sleep in my car, I took a chance and ordered it anyway. The entire order included a mattress and a car air pump. Regarding the mattress: I tested it by laying it out in my car (Citroen Berlingo). I then noticed that there was some mold on one of the sides. I cleaned it off and hope that it doesn't come back. Once inflated I performed a laying test. It's nice to lay on and it's perfect for the festival. Naturally, this mattress can't replace your normal bed mattress, but it's pure luxury for the days at event. The mattress fits perfectly in my car. Before we put it in, we took the back seats out. So, it fit perfectly. The air pump: The air pump has various attachments. The mattress needs two different attachments, which you can find on the pump. The pump is plugged into the car's cigarette lighter. However, the plug was damaged (a little on the solder seam). Since my friend mechanically inclined, he was able to repair it and the part worked really well after it was put back together and pumped the mattress up in no time. Overall, I am very happy with the mattress. I am looking forward to the firmness test at the festival. I hope that it doesn't lose air and lasts a long time. Also, that the mold doesn't return. After this test I can already recommend it in any case. Should I have a different experience, I will revise my recommendation accordingly (if possible).","There are hardly any reviews available, so I was initially very skeptical.

Of course, this mattress cannot replace your own bed, but it is pure luxury for days at the event. The mattress fits perfectly in my car. We had to remove the back seats beforehand. Thus, it fits perfectly. The air pump: The pump has various adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which are also available on the pump.

I will be eager to see the hardness test at the festival. I hope it doesn't lose air and lasts a long time. Likewise, I hope the mold doesn't return. After the test, I can already recommend it.

Leider ist der Kalender durch die läppische Verarbeitung direkt an Tag 1 über mehrere Türchen aufgerissen. Am 21. Türchen waren garkeine Türchen mehr dran und ich musste mehr oder weniger meinem Sohn erlauben dass er dementsprechend auch die restlichen Teile rausnehmen darf da sie ihm quasi schon entgegen gefallen kamen. Die Teile kommen öfters durcheinander raus was oft heißt, dass man das Auto wieder auseinander bauen muss um die Teile an zu bringen. Nachdem das Auto komplett zusammen gebaut ist fallen beim Spielen Teile ab. (Am meisten die Frontscheibe. Diese lässt sich auch sehr schlecht wieder anbringen.) An sich würde ich diesen Kalender nicht mehr kaufen und auch keinem weiter empfehlen. Eventuell überdenken die Hersteller die Art wie sie den Kalender gestaltet haben für die nächste Ausgabe und machen es besser. :\","Definitely not worth more than 10 euros... Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me. :( 1. For the quick delivery. 2. For the idea behind the toy. Unfortunately, multiple doors on the calendar ripped on the first day thanks to its shoddy manufacturing. The 21st door didn't even have a door cover any more, which meant that I must, more or less, allow my son to open all the remaining doors and take the remaining parts out since the parts pretty much just had already fallen out. The parts often come out mixed up, which often means that the car needs to be taken apart repeatedly to get all the parts in the right places. After the car is completely built parts fall off while playing. (Usually the front windshield. It is also really difficult to reinstall.) For the most part, I wouldn't purchase this calendar again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Maybe the designers will reconsider the way they designed the calendar and improve it for the next installment. :\","Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately, I can only give this calendar two stars. 1. For the fast shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy.
