1322,这是第二次从亚马逊上购买帮宝适尿布，曾经在宝宝2个月的时候买过一箱，选择了欧洲进口纸张的尿布，第一次购买经历还是比较满意的，宝宝整夜就用一张尿布，的确可以满足12个小时不换尿布。,"I've purchased Pampers diapers from Amazon twice already, my baby was 2 months old when I purchased a box of diapers, I decided on diapers made of imported European paper, I was happy with my first buy in general, All night, the infant used them, without changing diapers, one diaper can last 12 hours.","This is the second time I've purchased Pampers diapers from Amazon.

1323,但是这次购买L号的尿布，一箱里面有2包分开包装，打开后就觉得纸张比较松，跟进口帮宝适有明显区别，给宝宝用了之后，还算可以，没有漏尿也没有红疹等迹象。,"However, I purchased L-size diapers this time, 2 packs, each packed separately, are contained in a box, When I opened it, the paper felt loose, which is certainly not the case with imported Pampers, red rash and further symptoms.","However, this time when buying the L size diapers, each box contains two packs separately packaged.

1324,但是到了第二包尿布，开始使用后宝宝的大腿内侧立马就出现了红疹，至今还没有褪去。,"But after using the second pack of diapers, the infant developed a rash on the inside of his thighs that hasn't yet disappeared.","However, after the second pack of diapers, as soon as they were used, the baby's inner thighs immediately developed red rashes, which have not faded to this day.","However, after the second pack of diapers, as soon as they were used, the baby's inner thighs immediately developed red rashes, which have not faded to this day.",16.192940337079555,0.8169655203819275,0.7090229988098145,16.192940337079555,0.8169655203819275,0.7090229392051697

1328,这是我网购这么久以来，看到最差的一次包装运输，完全没有什么保护措施，缓冲泡沫，包裹缓冲层材料等，什么都没有。,"Since I've been doing a lot of internet shopping, this is the worst wrapping and shipping I've ever encountered, there are absolutely no protective measures, such as cushioning foam, wrapping materials, or cushioning layer materials, etc, nothing at all.","This is the worst packaging and shipping experience I've had in my online shopping so far.

1338,昨晚拿回家试了一下，瓶盖推开之后，吸管和盖子之间的距离太近了，因为吸管的位置是正向垂直的，所以儿子总是要把盖子上面的凸起含住喝水，觉得这个地方是否可以改进一下。,"I brought it home and gave it a shot last night, the space between the straw and the bottle cap was too close when the bottle cap was pushed off, because the straw is vertical, my son had to catch the bump on the top to sip water, I believe this location can be enhanced.","The other day, I took it home to try.

1339,看来其他牌子的吸管杯把吸管做的倾斜还是有道理的，小孩子的东西，真的就是在乎安全和舒适。,"Other manufacturers of straw cups appear to tilt the straw, which makes sense, children's items are very concerned with safety and comfort.","It seems that other brands making the straw tilted in sipper cups do have some道理, after all, it's just for children, and safety and comfort really matter.","It seems other brands design tilted straws in sippy cups make sense, after all, it's simply for children—safety and comfort really matter.",7.173095622076889,0.7621272206306458,0.5730541944503784,8.055259301867162,0.7928590178489685,0.6224943995475769

1420,个人觉得还可以接受，一来价格便宜，且700多页分成两本，作为平装本也较好翻阅；二来是不同于米开朗基罗全集那本，画作占了主体，达芬奇这本黑白手稿占了大部分，对于预算有限的、非美术专业读者而言，这版作为欣赏画作和手稿的性价比是最高的。,"Personally, I believe it to be appropriate, First off, it's inexpensive, and it comes in two paperback volumes with a combined total of more than 700 pages, It differs from Michelangelo's full works, which are primarily made up of paintings, in two ways, the majority of Da Vinci's manuscripts are in black and white, this edition is the most affordable for readers with tight budgets and non-art majors to appreciate paintings and writings.","The personal opinion is that it is acceptable. First, the price is affordable, and the 700-plus pages are divided into two volumes, making it easier to browse as a paperback. Second, unlike the complete works of Michelangelo, where the paintings take the main role, this volume of Da Vinci is mostly composed of black-and-white manuscripts.

1457,本书的笔调极其平淡，是那种白开水一样的平淡，遣词造句对简约追求到了极致，情节也是像夏日午后的大街一样，寂静平淡。,"The plot of this novel is as quiet and flat as a street in the middle of a summer afternoon, the tone of the book is similar to that of plain water, and the words and sentences used strive for the utmost simplicity.","The tone of this book is extremely plain, like plain water, and the language is simplified to its absolute essence.

1459,最后收集在一起，冠名《当我们谈论爱情时我们在谈论什么》。,"In the end, they were compiled under the heading ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.""","The final collection is named ""When We Talk About Love, What Are We Talking About?""","The final compilation is named ""When We Talk About Love, What Are We Talking About?""",20.14311148867193,0.8096422553062439,0.7166409492492676,20.143111488671934,0.8424097895622253,0.7620126008987427
1460,我想，这个小说集，以及它的标题，像是一种行为艺术，作者想表达的是，爱情不止是舞台上的悲欢离合，都市传说中的海枯石烂，也不只是你侬我侬的如胶似漆，爱情不止是以上也不应该被以上代表，爱情也是平淡如水的生活，枯燥无味的日复一日，也有对生活的无措，现实的逃避，未来的茫然。,"I consider the title of this anthology of novels to be a type of performance art, the author aims to convey that love is more than only the emotions experienced on stage, the rocks and dry sea in urban tales, and the bond that binds you and I together, not only should the aforementioned not be seen as a representation of love, but also of a life that is dull day in and day out, as plain as water, with a loss of life, denial of reality, and uncertainty about the future.","The novel collection and its title seem like a form of performance art. The author wants to express that love is not just the tragic and romantic scenes on stage, the eternal vows in urban legends, or the sweet and clingy affection of ""you and I.""

Love is also the simple and ordinary life, the monotonous day after day, as well as the helplessness in facing life, the escape from reality, and the confusion about the future.","The novel collection and its title resemble a form of performance art.

1461,阅读这本书时你脑海里可能回想起你身旁吵架的夫妻，认识的人的索然无味的婚姻，以及不如意的感情。,"While you read this book, images of the quarreling couples around you, the uninteresting marriages of individuals you know, and the unsatisfying relationships can be running through your head.","When you read this book, you may imagine the arguing couple next to you, the dull marriages of people you know, and unsatisfying relationships.","When you read this book, you may recall the arguing couple next to you, the dull marriages of people you know, and unsatisfying relationships.",24.41029622672016,0.8012930154800415,0.7391945123672485,24.41029622672016,0.7996957898139954,0.7526060342788696
1462,这正是我不推荐阅读的原因，从审美的角度上讲，本书的文笔和情节都索然无味，除非你的生活惊涛骇浪或者甜蜜得如生活在糖果城堡，否则你得阅读时的感觉就是见怪不怪和无聊。,"Since the writing and plot of this book are dull from an artistic standpoint, I do not advocate reading it, unless your life is difficult or sweet, like living in a candy castle, you will feel uncomfortable when you are forced to read it, not strange and dull.","This is precisely the reason I don't recommend reading this book.

1463,而从思想深度上，日常情节并没有让人眼前一亮或者扩展一个人的思路和视野（这点不同于马尔克斯的《霍乱时期的爱情》），短暂的片段也没有探讨任何问题，比如是什么样的错误导致了爱情的失败？,"In contrast to Marquez's ""Love in the Time of Cholera,"" the daily narratives did not engage viewers or broaden their perspectives in terms of depth of thought, and the brief clips did not address any issues, such as What type of error caused the failure of love?","In terms of ideological depth, the everyday plot does not impress the eye or expand one's thinking and perspective (a point different from Maupassant's ""The Tale of the Heir"").

1466,作者的想法更多地通过技巧和体裁表达而不是故事情节，也是本书阅读体验比较差的原因。,This book's reading experience is generally subpar since the author's thoughts are conveyed more effectively through technique and genre than through a clear narrative.,"The author's ideas are more expressed through techniques and genres rather than the plot, which is also the reason why the reading experience of this book is somewhat poor.","The author's ideas are more conveyed through techniques and styles rather than the plot, which is also why the book's reading experience is poor.",11.11696140915019,0.8449279069900513,0.7710874080657959,26.541610738864318,0.8433859944343567,0.7761784791946411

1472,不知道是不是为了举例而编纂的故事，如果举一些作者亲历的案例会更有信服力。,"I'm not sure if it's fiction compiled for the sake of illustration, but it would be more believable if certain cases experienced by the author were provided.","The user is unsure if it's a story compiled for illustrative purposes.

1524,用了一段时间，总体来说画面还可以，感觉不出什么差别来，就是这个系统让人看着纠结，开机时间明显有点慢，也没法进行很好的设置，再带的软件更是不用评论了，响应速度那就更一般了，和同事家的比起来那不是一个数量级的。,"After using it for a while, I can't really see the difference, but overall the picture is not horrible, however this system makes people look jumbled, boots up slowly, I can't make proper settings, and the software I bring is not required, when compared to my colleagues' responses, the response time is not significantly slower after commenting.","After using it for a while, the overall picture is acceptable, and I don't feel like there are significant differences.

1955,买来之后其他的都没什么问题，就是在软件连接的时候，怎么都连不上，我家是TP的路由器，上网查了之后发现好多人都有这个问题，弄了两个多小时，各种改路由器的设置，最后我用360WIFI作为媒介给弄好的，期间给小米客服打电话，他们对这个问题也没有什么解决方法，直接就让我联系亚马逊进行售后。,"Other things were fine once I got it, but when the program was connected, I was unable to connect, a TP router is at my house, I discovered after searching the Internet that this issue affects a lot of people, more than two hours later, I made several adjustments, in the end, I configured the router using 360WIFI as the medium, during that time, I called Xiaomi customer service, but they didn't have an answer for this issue, they merely instructed me to get in touch with Amazon for customer support.","After buying it, there were no other problems, but when trying to connect to the software, I couldn't connect at all.
